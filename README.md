### About

I am currently in the final year of my Master of Engineering degree. By the end
of 2021, I would like to work in the field of machine learning and/or artificial
intelligence, ideally abroad.

If you would like to get in touch with me to discuss a job offer, please do not
hesitate to contact me :-)
